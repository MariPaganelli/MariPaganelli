ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MariPaganelli
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in improving my knowledge in Technologies, and my goal is to make a career change in 2025.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full-stack development.

ðŸ“« You can reach me through my <a href= "mailto:contato:marianapaganelli@gmail.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>, or my <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/maripaganelli">LinkedIn</a>
<br>âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Chiropractor since 2012, and the first thing I see when I look to a person is the posture.
